# Generally:
# Leave village alone
# Unlock orphanage and craft goddess statues to donate them for fast Destiny points
# Do adventure guild stuff
# Eventually the big guy who's in a hurry will unlock the Bandit Camp
# Beat the bandits, search the one to get Rusty Sword
# Go to smith's village and spend 10 steel to reforge it at the repairsmith's forge.
#  getting scrap is slow from Ruins, but even slower from DK Farm with Sword Spirit + Iron Golem
# Graduate and finish (you can graduate early, as long as you have the rusty sword). The game will let you graduate before getting the sword, which makes ED2 unwinnable.
