Remember:
* Use the ultimate love, villain, and justice titles for the boosts after reincarnating
* In every run, once you get to Academic City, be sure to unlock Smelly Satchet and make many of them. This generates Stench for Alchemy.
* use fire drake if stats are needed.

TODOs:
* increase resource caps
  * stone x120
  * wreath (for Destiny regen, +0.01 each). 100 == 1 regen/s. Meh. Need 10k+ to be of any use. Still, need a load of destiny to do Fate so maybe worthwhile for automating runs involving Magic City?
  * always more inspiration gain %
* beat serious spearman


# Long term TODOs
* all three wands
* medicine x500 or more. (so I can buy it all one time and then not need to use a sloth slot)


Full reincarnation / sin farming:
This assumes the following required summons:
* Immortal Rat - pelt regen

# Sin -> Regen -> Profit
Spending sin to increase inventory size is a great combination with summons that give effects to those items.
* Elder Treant = Apple max +1 per Wood, Apple regen +0.001 per wood, Physical/Magical/Special Seed Max +10 per apple
  Getting 1000 wood would result in 1 apple regen per second.
* Queen Bee = Destiny regen +0.009 per Honey
  1000 honey is 9 destiny regen. Not great. If sin farming becomes easy later, it may be worthwhile, but probably not. Need to be getting hundreds of destiny per second at minimum.
* Virtue and Malice are not useful for quick sin farming runs, but they are very nice for farming inspiration.

# DK T1 item farming
Adjust the party so that demon king can summon and then immediately get killed. Golden Slime and then You is a good series. Watch out for attack speed changes messing it up.

Silver Dragon - 5 rune (common), dragon claw (very rare)
Golden Slime - 1 rare metal (semi-common), 150 gold (common)
Forest Fairy - 5 herb (common)
Phantom Whale - 5 pelt, 5 wheat, 5 stone, 5 dung, 5 herb (all common)

No drops (or far too rare to be worthwhile, or just far outclassed by lower level summons):
 Dragon Baby
 Iron Golem. no scrap metal farming =-(
 Scarlet Dragon
 Treant
 Brown Slime
 Rock Bird
 Tree Golem
 Hell Butterfly
 King Cobra
 Sandworm
 Lesser Wyvern
