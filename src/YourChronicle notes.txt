Remember:
* Use the ultimate love, villain, and justice titles for the boosts after reincarnating
* In every run, once you get to Academic City, be sure to unlock Smelly Satchet and make many of them. This generates Stench for Alchemy.
* use fire drake if stats are needed.

TODOs:
* increase resource caps
  * stone x80
  * wreath (for Destiny regen, +0.01 each). 100 == 1 regen/s. Meh. Need 10k+ to be of any use. Still, need a load of destiny to do Fate so maybe worthwhile for automating runs involving Magic City?
  * always more inspiration gain %
* beat serious spearman. just farm up gluttony boosts for a while. From https://steamcommunity.com/app/1546320/discussions/0/3271312871360609019/
* beat ED6:
  Punish the bullies.
  Defeat serious father before leaving the village and refuse training.
  Clear areas until Sigurd appears.
  Farm for physical attack:
  * buy beef, pork. make beef steak, firewood.
  * gluttony: leave 10+ beef. eat beef, pork, beef steak, salt
  * dungeon:  rock hill top, dragon's nest (for gold), moon forest abyss (for wine for beef steak)
  * use physical attack equipment and 2nd equipment.
  * Greater Demon familiars
  * switch to body focus for Envy
  Use fire drake, goblin elite, and then all stat boosters. Mercenary title.
  I used my main character with Spiked Spear attack.

  Defeat sigurd. As the reason for being so strong pick "For your father" and clear all Spearman conversations (up to 16/16).
  You can graduate now. Some conversations are locked by graduating (at least some of the eavesdropping). Do it before graduating if you care. It doesn't change the steps needed for the ending.
  Defeat the demon king and finish conversation with him.


# Long term TODOs
* medicine x500 or more. (so I can buy it all one time and then not need to use a sloth slot)
* Aim for 3 cerulean orbs (instant+loop+dungeon effects by 6% total), 1 emerald(10% global drop chance), 1 crimson(20% status). 3 cerulean is the priority, the others don't really matter.

Full reincarnation / sin farming:
This assumes the following required summons:
* Immortal Rat - pelt regen
* Tree Golem - wood regen
and these optional ones:
* Elder Treant - causes wood to generate apples
* Treant - bonus for making firewood
* Troll - bonus for making leather and durable leather

For Evil City amnesiac, I've done all three options (let die, save, save+sister). @ Doesn't matter? sister to be safe.

For Dragon City classy lady, I've done (rice ball with fish) (mushroom) (bamboo shoot) @ any difference?
For Dragon City classy lady, I've done (let's practice some more) (this is good) (this is different) @ any difference? 
For Magic City schools, I've done (Practical, leads to Antimagic wand). (Classical, leads to harvest wand for more research). (Theory, elemental wand). need: (Genius)
For Magic City, Practical School, I've asked Fili to teach me. Need: "Don't ask Fili to teach me"
For Magic City, Arcana forum, I've "Talked with Fili" and "Don't talk with Fili". @ Talk to him or it's nothing. Any reward for talking?

# Sin -> Regen -> Profit
Spending sin to increase inventory size is a great combination with summons that give effects to those items.
* Elder Treant = Apple max +1 per Wood, Apple regen +0.001 per wood, Physical/Magical/Special Seed Max +10 per apple
  Getting 1000 wood would result in 1 apple regen per second.
* Queen Bee = Destiny regen +0.009 per Honey
  1000 honey is 9 destiny regen. Not great. If sin farming becomes easy later, it may be worthwhile, but probably not. Need to be getting hundreds of destiny per second at minimum.
* Soldier Bee = Flowers give 0.1% Habit efficiency, and +1 honey max
  Spending sin on max flowers probably isn't worthwhile, but it may become worthwhile eventually.
* Virtue and Malice are not useful for quick sin farming runs, but they are very nice for farming inspiration.

# DK T1 item farming
Adjust the party so that demon king can summon and then immediately get killed. Golden Slime and then You is a good series. Watch out for attack speed changes messing it up.

Silver Dragon - 5 rune (common), dragon claw (very rare)
Golden Slime - 1 rare metal (semi-common), 150 gold (common)
Forest Fairy - 5 herb (common)
Phantom Whale - 5 pelt, 5 wheat, 5 stone, 5 dung, 5 herb (all common)

No drops (or far too rare to be worthwhile, or just far outclassed by lower level summons):
 Dragon Baby
 Iron Golem. no scrap metal farming =-(
 Scarlet Dragon
 Treant
 Brown Slime
 Rock Bird
 Tree Golem
 Hell Butterfly
 King Cobra
 Sandworm
 Lesser Wyvern
